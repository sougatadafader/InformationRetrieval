Explanation:
============
PageRank is a query-independent metadata that improves ranking for web search. There is a concept
of in-link (number of links that point to that web page) and out-link (number of links that 
originate from that web-page). Thereby the number of inlinks for each page imparts in calculating
the rank of that web-page. The page-rank is also boosted if a more popular website points to that
website.For example a page ABC having one in-link from a popular page like CNN or BBC wil have 
higher page rank value than another page p2 which has more than three-four inlinks from less popular
websites, such as personal blogs. In this example "United States" has higher page rank than 
"United Kingdom" despite the former having lesser number of inlinks than the later.

Moreover, no of outlinks are are also considered for pagerank. If a page P1 is getting an in-link
from another page, say p2 and p2 has several out-links, then the effect on page-rank of P1 for the
in-link from p2 is very less.


Conclusion:
===========

From the above results, we can see that the usual order of a pagerank is when a page has many in-links.
But there are also cases which are explined above where the number of in-links doesn't play any part in
the pagerank calculation.
